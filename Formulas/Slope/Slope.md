The slope formula is:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

where:
- \( m \) is the slope,
- \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are two points on the line.

### How to Solve for the Slope:
1. **Identify two points** on the line, labeled as \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \).
2. **Subtract the y-coordinates**: \( y_2 - y_1 \) (this finds the vertical change or "rise").
3. **Subtract the x-coordinates**: \( x_2 - x_1 \) (this finds the horizontal change or "run").
4. **Divide** the difference in y-values by the difference in x-values to get \( m \).

### Example Calculation:
#### Given:
Two points: \( (2, 5) \) and \( (6, 13) \)

#### Step 1: Plug into the formula
$$
m = \frac{13 - 5}{6 - 2}
$$

#### Step 2: Simplify
$$
m = \frac{8}{4} = 2
$$

The slope of the line passing through \( (2,5) \) and \( (6,13) \) is **2**.
