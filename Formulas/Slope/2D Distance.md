The 2D distance formula is:

$$
\text{dist} = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2}
$$

where:
- \( \Delta x \) is the difference in the x-coordinates: \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \),
- \( \Delta y \) is the difference in the y-coordinates: \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 \),
- `dist` is the distance between the two points `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)`.

### How to Solve Using the 2D Distance Formula:
1. **Find the differences in the x and y coordinates**:
   - Calculate \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \) (the horizontal change).
   - Calculate \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 \) (the vertical change).
2. **Square each of the differences**:
   - Square \( \Delta x \) and \( \Delta y \).
3. **Add the squares**: \( (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 \).
4. **Take the square root** of the sum to get the distance.

### Example Calculation:
#### Given:
Points \( (x_1, y_1) = (1, 2) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (4, 6) \)

#### Step 1: Find the differences:
- \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \)
- \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 2 = 4 \)

#### Step 2: Square the differences:
- \( (\Delta x)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( (\Delta y)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \)

#### Step 3: Add the squares:
- \( 9 + 16 = 25 \)

#### Step 4: Take the square root:
- \( \sqrt{25} = 5 \)

The distance between the points \( (1, 2) \) and \( (4, 6) \) is **5** units.
