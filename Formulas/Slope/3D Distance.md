The 3D distance formula is:

$$
\text{dist} = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2}
$$

where:
- \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \) is the difference in the x-coordinates,
- \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 \) is the difference in the y-coordinates,
- \( \Delta z = z_2 - z_1 \) is the difference in the z-coordinates,
- \( \text{dist} \) is the distance between the two points \( (x_1, y_1, z_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2, z_2) \).

### How to Solve Using the 3D Distance Formula:
1. **Find the differences in the x, y, and z coordinates**:
   - Calculate \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \),
   - Calculate \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 \),
   - Calculate \( \Delta z = z_2 - z_1 \).
2. **Square each of the differences**:
   - Square \( \Delta x \), \( \Delta y \), and \( \Delta z \).
3. **Add the squares**: \( (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2 \).
4. **Take the square root** of the sum to get the distance.

### Example Calculation:
#### Given:
Points \( (x_1, y_1, z_1) = (1, 2, 3) \) and \( (x_2, y_2, z_2) = (4, 6, 8) \)

#### Step 1: Find the differences:
- \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \),
- \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 2 = 4 \),
- \( \Delta z = z_2 - z_1 = 8 - 3 = 5 \).

#### Step 2: Square the differences:
- \( (\Delta x)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \),
- \( (\Delta y)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \),
- \( (\Delta z)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \).

#### Step 3: Add the squares:
- \( 9 + 16 + 25 = 50 \).

#### Step 4: Take the square root:
- \( \sqrt{50} \approx 7.071 \).

The distance between the points \( (1, 2, 3) \) and \( (4, 6, 8) \) is approximately **7.071** units.
