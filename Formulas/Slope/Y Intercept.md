$$
y = mx + b
$$

where:
- \( m \) is the slope of the line, given by [Slope Equation](obsidian://open?vault=Documentation&file=Formulas%2FSlope%2FSlope),
- \( b \) is the y-intercept, which is the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \).

### How to Solve Using the Slope-Intercept Form:
1. **Identify the slope** \( m \) and the y-intercept** \( b \) from the equation.
   - If the equation is already in the form \( y = mx + b \), you can directly read off the values.
2. **Plot the y-intercept** \( b \) on the y-axis. This is where the line crosses the y-axis when \( x = 0 \).
3. **Use the slope** \( m \) to find another point on the line:
   - If \( m \) is a fraction \( \frac{a}{b} \), from the y-intercept, move up \( a \) units and to the right \( b \) units.
   - If \( m \) is negative, move down \( a \) units and to the right \( b \) units.
4. **Draw the line** through these points.

### Example Calculation:
#### Given the equation:
$$
y = 2x + 3
$$

#### Step 1: Identify the slope and y-intercept:
- Slope \( m = 2 \)
- Y-intercept \( b = 3 \)

#### Step 2: Plot the points:
- Plot the y-intercept at \( (0, 3) \) on the graph.
- From \( (0, 3) \), use the slope \( m = 2 \) (which is \( \frac{2}{1} \)): move **up 2 units** and **right 1 unit** to the point \( (1, 5) \).

#### Step 3: Draw the line through these points.

This is the process for working with the slope-intercept form. Let me know if you'd like further clarification! ðŸš€
